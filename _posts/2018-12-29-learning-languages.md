## Learning languages
### How to go about learning a new language!


This week‘s topic here on **Jack Dexter Blog** is the learning of new languages.

This article is examining the question how to go about learning a new language.

First of all I want to state that learning a new language is more achievable than you might think. In fact I would go so far as to say that anybody who wants to learn a new language can do so. I admit that it takes a fair amount of work to achieve fluency in a language, but with the following tips and tricks you will be well prepared for your language learning journey.

In this post I want to share with you what I found out, researching the best ways of learning a new language and also throwing in some of my own experience.
Many of these tricks I have used others I wished I would have used and all of them I am definitely planning to integrate in my next language learning endevaors.


While researching, it appeared to me that almost all advice you can find on the internet about learning languages can be divided into three categories:

1. Attitude
2. Habits
3. Out of your Comfortzone

Therefore let's start examining these categories one by one.

#### Attitude

As with learning anything, a positive attitude or growth mindset, can really improves the whole learning experience. This is particularly true for learning languages.

Preparing your mind to learn can really be a gamechanger, helping you to learn far more than you might have deemed possible. Author Brian Tracy states in his book Accelerated learning techniques that preparing your mind to learn is the single most important step you can do before starting a learning session, to accelerate your learning, so it is therefore to no surprise that most of the language experts agree, that having a postive attitude is crucial to learn a new language.


So here are the five most important attitudes I found during my research are:

1. **Being curious**
It‘s about asking a lot of question and trying to imitate the learning style of small children. Be fascinated with the world around you and try to make sense out of it in a new language. With every language comes a new way of thinking, said somebody. So be curious and explore.

2. **language goals**,
It‘s about remembering, your motivation and having a clear objective in mind.
Why do you want to learn a new language?
Maybe it‘s because you have family  members in different country maybe it is because of work or maybe it‘s because you like the culture whatever the reason, it‘s good to keep it in mind and be clear about your objectives. This will help you specifically in difficult times, where you might feel like you are loos ing your motivation.


3. **use the word yet**
When talking with someone about your learning endevaors or even when you are thinking to yourself try to use the word yet. This concept comes from the school of growth mindset and how to help children to learn. So when you try to tell someone that you don‘t understand, because you can‘t speak the language. Say that you don‘t understand **yet**, because you don‘t speak so well **yet**.
Professor and author writes: QUOTE HERE
it seems like this word triggers your brain that a tensiable solution is very close.

4. **victory pose**
Doing a victory pose or in general just standing in a strong posture right before a learning session routine can not only help you to get into a good mood, but can also help you to learn more. This video explains in further detail how our body posture effect our performance.

5. **embracing mistakes**,
If you want it or not in the beginning and even long after learning a new language, there will always be mistakes. So it‘s better to befriend them right from the beginning, since errors are a vital part of the whole learning process.

So keep this attitudes in mind when starting on your language learning journey.


#### Habits

Lets move to the bread and butter of any language learning endevaor: **Habits!**

So here are the top 5 most useful and interesting habits, from my own experience:

1. **half an hour of conversation in your target language**
 Conversing daily in your new language is one of the most if not the most effective habit there is. Of course the more time you manage to set aside, the greater the effects.

Because it is such a important habit to establish let‘s also look at some common problems!

Main difficulties in establishing this habit:

    1. I can‘t converse with someone yet

__Possible answers:__
  * Prepare you conversations in advance, e.g. before a skype call write down some useful phrases in an online document and have it opened on your desktop while calling
  * get list of the 400 most used words and use it during your first conversations

    2. I don‘t have a language conversation partner

__Possible Answers:__
  * Find a genuine friend (wikihow find a friend link)
  * use an online site or platform
  * **self talk/thinking out loud** Talking to yourself has similar positive effects like conversing with someone, and is one of the favorite tricks of many language learning experts.


2. **daily media immersion**,
There is so much media around us and it is actually not as hard to switch our media habits to another language as you might think. There is music, movies, podcasts, games books, comics, and many many more and you can find many of these for free in the internet. Although real conversation time is more valuable then media consumption time, immersing yourself in media of target language is a great tool to learn a new language. Also using media you already like might facilitate the establishment of this habit. For example if you like instructional sports videos watch instructional sports videos in your target language, youtube even has a great subtitle function for this.

3. **use language app or course** the most recommended, regarding vocabulary learning are duolinguo and anki. In general you want to set aside some time every day to learn and revise vocab and grammar. No secret to it the more you practice the better you get. Interesting side fact I found while researching: Vocabulary retention is enhanced if we combine it with some sort of physical activity. So walking or pedalling on a standing bike, while learning vocabulary, can help you remember it better.


4. **learn pronunciation and start singing in that language**
This can be done with a partner or a video or by reading, but just spending some time focusing on the sounds of a given language, will help you a lot in learning it and pronouncing things right. I don‘t know exactly why but there seems to be something magical about music and singing when it comes to language learning, I once met a girl in Australia which spoke native english, when I found out that she was german I asked her about her secret. Her response: Singing. This  is also being investigated by researchers and seems to be that we are able to remember pronunciation better when combining it with music. So next time you jump into the shower start singing in the language you are learning.


5. **have a language notebook for your language**
Writing down anything from vocabulary drawings, detailed grammar explanations to journalling every night before going to bed is a great habit, which has worked very well in my own experience.

Habits are a great tool to help us allocate our time where we want. And the rule is the more time we spent dealing with the language we want to learn the closer we get to learn that language.



#### 3. Getting out of your Comfort zone

Let‘s move to our last category: **Getting out of your Comfort zone!**

Almost all sources I found in the internet agreed that learning a language requires from you to get out of your comfort zone! And in my own experience it has prooved it self as the most important step towards learning new languages.

1. **travel to the country and start working there.**
Best option in my opinion, which has lead to really fast progress in learning the language. Of course this option is not tangible for everybody, but if it is, I highly recommend leaving you comfort zone that way! Also you don‘t need to work for money very often you learn even more by volunteering. Some of the most awesome experiences I had abroad, were while volunteering. And in retrospect it‘s these experiences that helped me not only to learn the language but also to learn some valuable life lessons.


2. **approach people of your target language in real Life**
Regardless if you travelled to a country where the language is spoken or not, approaching people and starting random conversations is a great way to practice that language. It is really a great experience to get to know new people and there is always something to learn from every person. Always remember the curious child in you.

3. **approach people of your target language online**
Sometimes there is no way to make contact with people in real life or maybe find it difficult to approach a stranger in real life, then you have still the option to use other means. Approach people by writing emails, making call and looking for a language friend in forums. On the internet the options are countless so its just a matter of not getting lost in that sea of information.

4. **Only respond in the language you are learning, don‘t switch languages**
This one might be of importance when you travel to a country where most of the people speak another language like english. Because then there is always the option for you to switch to another easier language for you or the person you are communicating with. Simply pretend that you don‘t speak english, and stay persistent in responding in your target language.

5. **Spend as much time possible using your new language**
We have touched upon it already a couple of times in this post, but what really matters is the effort and time you put into your language endeavors. And the attitudes and habits help us with putting in that effort and time. Unfortunately these attitudes and habits also have their limitations. Therefore in the end of the day what will help you is you pushing yourself to using your new language more.

So in the end I want to leave you with the words of Julien Gaudfroy, French-born Chinese-language host and Beijing restaurateur:
>“People always ask me, ‘Chinese is so hard to study, >how did you do it?’. They say, ‘I’m trying to study >English’ or ‘I’m trying to study French and it’s so >hard, and I spend time and it’s still too hard’ and my >answer is always, ‘well, spend more time then’….There’s >no secret.”




So to sum it all up!

In this post we looked at effective ways of how to learn languages and if we just keep our three categories in mind:
1. Working on a positive learning attitude
2. Establishing sustainable learning habits and
3. Getting out of our comfort zone a bit,
Then we might be able to learn a language faster than we would have believed.


Thank you very much for reading!
