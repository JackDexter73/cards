## Habit review: Reading
## Part 1:Why should we be reading?



This week‘s topic here on **Jack Dexter Blog** is reading.
And in today's post we will take a look at the history of reading and check out why it‘s worth to read.


But before we start let‘s look at some historic facts:


*The origins of human language are dated somewhere between 100,000 and
50,000 years ago, though many theories emphasize that the evolution of language was a very gradual process.


*The oldest cave drawing we know of dates back to 35000 years B.C.

*The oldest written records of language seem to have appeared around 6000 years B.C.

*The oldest text we have is the Dipilio Tablet, which dates to around 5,260 B.C.

*The printing press was invented 1439

*The first public electronic digital library started in 1971


If we look at the book publishing rates of the last couple years we find that every year there are more than 2 million books being published. Which results of more than 5000 books being published every day.

With so many many book being published every year one might believe that people are also reading more.

But are people in general reading more or maybe even less than they used to?

That‘s actually a difficult question to answer. Countless reports especially in developed countrys state that people are spending less time in front of books.

According to 2014 report by Common Sense Media[8] for example states a sharp decline in reading habits of teenagers in the age of 9 to 17.
On the other side
these reports might have a very narrow definition of reading, where reading of social media sites, internet articles and online news are not included.

Other possible reasons for a decline in “traditional reading habits“ besides the bombardment of social media and existence of countless new gadgets around us, might be our educational system, which might discourage reading.

Now one might say if the trend goes down with books and we have other media and gadgets, e.g youtube and a cellphone, why the hack should I read more books.



So before I give you the chance to come up with yet another excuse to not read, which will be discussed in another blogpost.
I want to give you three personal benefits, why reading is good for you:





######First: Reading makes you smarter!


Actually it is already well established in our society that intelligent people read, and there have been a lot of studys confirming this relation. A Metaanalysis study by Mumper and Gerrig confirms that leisure reading improves socio-cognitive abilities.


Writer and Co-founder Elizabeth Oberg goes even further regarding the social benefits of reading and states:
>“Possibly the most striking finding is that,
>regardless of income, levels of reading for pleasure >correlate closely with levels of social life, >voting, and political activism, participation in >culture and fine arts, volunteerism, charity work, >and even regular exercise.“

Regarding cognitive abilities, there is evidence that reading fictious literature increases our brain"s connectivity.

One particular brain FMRI  study, discovered an increased resting state brain activity after conducting an experiment for 19 days. MRIs(brainscans) of the participants were measured before, during and after reading a novel. The researchers found an increased connectivity in the parts of the brain responsible for language receptivity—so much so that the heightened connectivity was retained days later, much like “muscle memory.”

So we are not mistaken if we say that "reading is for the mind, what exercise is for the body".


Therefore, summarizing the first Benefit:

READ! It will make you smarter!




#####Second: Reading helps you relaxe!

In contrast to the first benefit we presented, many people might argue with this one. Saying that lecture readings in school were never relaxing or that sitting on the couch and watching television is what helps them chill out really.

I don‘t want to make your school lecture reading time make seem prettier than it was and if you like chilling in front of the television that is of course your choice.

But still I want to invite you to try out reading as a means of relaxing.

In the journal of college teaching and learning results from an experiment were published, stating that reading had similar effects on reducing stress as other strategies like humor or Yoga. The experiment, consisted of measuring blood pressure and heart rate before and after 30 minute sessions of each strategy.

Another article states:
>University of Sussex and found that participants who were stressed needed only >six minutes of reading for their heart rates and muscle tension to subside. Six >minutes! Overall, reading reduced stress levels by 68 percent, closely followed >by listening to music (61 percent), drinking coffee (54 percent) and taking a >walk (42 percent). Dr. David Lewis describes the effect, “It really doesn’t >matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book >you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a >while exploring the domain of the author’s imagination.”


Besides all this scientific evidence it makes sense to read something you like and if you haven‘t found books you like, try something new, maybe you are into (criminal storys maybe you like science books, maybe japanese manga). There are so many genres out there and I am sure that there is this one book if not a dozen of books that can give you a great reading experience, loosing yourself in the story, making you feel relaxed and entertained at the same time.

So maybe next time when you want to relax and switch off, pick up a book and start reading as an alternative to watching television and web surfing or video games.

Let's also remember that as with any habit the true benefits come after a certain time, the same is true for reading, so don't expect to feel absolutely relaxed after reading one time.

Therefore, summarizing the second Benefit:

READ! You will feel at ease!





###### 3 READ almost every great person in history was a reader.

So far you have seen a lot of scientific evidence that reading can help you relax and makes you smarter.
But don‘t take my word for granted, scientific studies often just show us very limited results, due to low numbers of participants and experiment design.

So for our last benefit I want you to draw from you own experience. Look at your own life and consider the historic facts we looked upon in the beginning of the article. What is the number one habit of people you admire for their wisdom and calmness and ability to think rationally, alive or dead ?

Great chances are that the number one habit is reading in deed.

So in the end I want you to leave you with the words of professor Loan, Fayaz Ahmad:

>Reading has been the passion of the greatest >personalities of all times. Humans have been reading >since ages and thus words of knowledge have been >passed on through generations. The reading habit >influences in the promotion of one's personal >development in particular and social progress in >general. Regular and systematic reading sharpens the >intellect, refines the emotions, elevates tastes and >provides perspectives for one's living; and thereby >prepares a person for an effective participation in >the social, religious, cultural and political life. >Reading fires the imagination of the person. It adds >new sight to eyes and new wisdom to mind.



Therefore, summarizing the third Benefit:

READ! It will add to your greatness!




Thank you very much for reading
























































Side notes:

Outline:
Introduction part(this week is reading)
Question of the article is it worth reading(state the question)

history of reading(how old is language how old is written language some breakthroughs in history)
a short of number of books being published
sketching a trend
so we see many people are reading
but here at Jack Dexter we dont follow the masses we want to look what is inside for us






Brainstorm:
Personal benefits:
first argument: its cognitively demanding(brain pictures) atleast I think it is cognitively more demanding so it makes you smarter
all the smart people in history were readers, if we want to be smart or clever its always worth a look what other smart people are doing
it‘s a nice habit that doesn‘t harm us and is doing good state some other research done
reading is a stabilizing habit meaning, that it can give stability in your life
→ choose 3

World benefits:
We here at Jack Dexter Blog believe in the future of humanity, it is really important to have more educated people around the world so that we don‘t walk around like neanderthals killing each other nothing against neanderthals apparently we have 4% of their genes
why is it the best way to educate
what about youtube etc.
Helps you become an expert in your field
connects us with other people(have you read this, it‘s nice to talk about these things, we don‘t have to be always be talking about food) let‘s start to talk about books more


So apart from being one of the most important break throughs in Human society books and the ability to read are an awesome habit to begin.


I believe its our responsibility to read, if we want to the world to become a better place.



So structured in 3:
reading is human kind breakthrough
reading is benefecial for you
reading is benefecial for the survival of our species



Thank you very much for reading this article. If you don‘t know what to read next, maybe subscribe to the newsletter and get updated with new interesting articles to read.

Next skill is writing, let us know in the comments, what do you think is reading worth it should we read more or do you have any good counterarguments. So for now peace out.



Are humans unique in the ability to read?
Not entirely

empathy :
Following characters’ lives teaches us empathy


Some important abstracts:

Readers of fiction tend to have better abilities of empathy and theory of mind (Mar et al., Journal of Personality 74: 1047–1078, 2006). We present a study designed to replicate this finding, rule out one possible explanation, and extend the assessment of social outcomes. In order to rule out the role of personality, we first identified Openness as the most consistent correlate. This trait was then statistically controlled for, along with two other important individual differences: the tendency to be drawn into stories and gender. Even after accounting for these variables, fiction exposure still predicted performance on an empathy task. Extending these results, we also found that exposure to fiction was positively correlated with social support. Exposure to nonfiction, in contrast, was associated with loneliness, and negatively related to social support.


Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of fiction, this chapter criticises a range of arguments from philosophy and literary theory that argue for a difference in the experience of reading fiction and reading non-fiction. It concludes that the difference is overstated; that the reality is complicated, and that a reader’s experience is a function of purposes the author had in writing and the reader has in reading, and that (as Stacie Friend has argued) more attention needs to be paid to genre—and that non-fiction is itself a genre (or rather a collection of genres).

"using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa (‘pig-deer’) made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one. Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by ∼40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world."
