  "I have spent my life searching for the answers that my father and my father's fathers failed to find. Who are we? Why do we create the vast monoliths that litter our planet? How do we harness our power? And why do we so often fail to use it? What is our purpose? I have asked the plants, but they do not remember. The plants have asked the rocks, but the rocks do not recall. Even the rocks do not recall. Every bone in my body tells me that the answers rest ... in every single one of us... oblivious to our destiny, uninterested in the search for truth, and rejecting guidance! And why would you want to listen to this blog, anyway? So it seems the answers begin with careful research, sensible thinking and as with many of fate's mysteries, it begins with a small amount of disobedience."
